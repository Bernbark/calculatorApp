# Calculator App
> This is designed to act as a simple calculator while also serving as a lesson in good comment practices, and writing tests before the code.

My intention with this project is to build my skillsets in programming. So far I have learned that unit testing is very important, but I have failed to apply test-driven development to my actual programming practices. Oftentimes I want to move quickly in my personal hobby projects because I want to get as much done as possible, but this is bad practice and I hope to eventually be employed as a programmer some day.

The focus of this project (and hopefully all projects moving forward) is to accurately and completely document the project, both through commits to GitHub as well as comments in code, describing functions and classes following specific protocols suggested/defined in Python. The secondary focus is to build testing skills, which often requires understanding how the method should work before writing it out.

## Installation

This requires TKinter to be installed in the environment running the program.

## Usage example

This is used for basic math, and may further be improved to calculate more complex problems.

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki][wiki]._
(There is no wiki, just leaving this for example)

## Development setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

```sh
make install
npm test
```
